# Stryktipset CLI

Serves the `stryktipset` package through a command-line tool called `st`.

### How-to

1. Run `make build` to compile the binary, use `make build-linux` for x-compiling to Linux based OS:es.
2. Run e.g. `st -sek 192` to test the commad-line tool

### Todo

```
[ ] Add an option to the Makefile to build the binary within a Docker container
[ ] Implement more of the stryktipset package functionality
```
